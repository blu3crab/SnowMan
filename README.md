# SnowMan
SnowMan (aka ShakeMeSnowman in the PlayStore) is a silly app just for holiday grins & giggles.

Shaking the phone results in a random colored snowman, a silly greeting & snow flakes falling.  
The full-screen app contains a CustomViewSnow generating an animation thread for each snowflake.  
The density of snowflakes is based on the magnitude of the shake detected by the ShakeEventListener.
